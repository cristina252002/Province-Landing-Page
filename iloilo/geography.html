	<p class=" geo" style="position: absolute;">Iloilo, officially known as the Province of Iloilo, is a region in the Western Visayas of the Philippines.<br>Let’s explore its geographical features:<br><br><strong>Location and Borders:</strong></p><br>

It is bordered by the province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo Channel to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the east, and the Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest.
Just off Iloilo’s southeast coast lies the island province of Guimaras, which was once part of Iloilo but is now an independent province.
Across Panay Gulf and Guimaras Strait, you’ll find Negros Occidental, occupying the northwestern half of the larger island of Negros.Area and Topography:
The province covers a total area of 5,000.83 square kilometers (1,930.83 sq mi), encompassing the central and eastern sections of Panay Island.
Iloilo City, the capital, is the center of the Iloilo–Guimaras Metropolitan Area and is geographically located within the province, although it remains politically independent from the provincial government.
The province is divided into two distinct geographic regions:
Highlands: The Central Panay Mountain Range forms the western border.
Lowland Plains: These account for a larger portion of the province.
Small islands east of the northernmost tip of Iloilo dot the Visayan Sea, with Pan de Azucar and Sicogon being well-known examples.

According to the 2020 census, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is 2,051,899.
If Iloilo City is included, the total population is 2,509,525.
Iloilo is a vibrant region with a rich cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and warm-hearted people. </p>
